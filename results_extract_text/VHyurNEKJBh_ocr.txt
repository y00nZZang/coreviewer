ABSTRACT

Learning from demonstrations (LfD) provides a data-efficient way for a robot to
learn a task by observing humans performing the task, without the need for an
explicit reward function. However, in many real-world scenarios (e.g., driving a
car) humans often perform the same task in different ways, motivated not only
by the primary objective of the task (e.g., reaching the destination safely) but also
by their individual preferences (e.g., different driving styles), leading to a multi-
modal distribution of demonstrations. In this work, we consider a Learning from
state-only Demonstration setup, where the reward function for the common ob-
jective of the task is known to the learning agent; however, the individual prefer-
ences leading to the variations in the demonstrations are unknown. We introduce
an imitation-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that formulates the
policy optimisation as a constrained RL problem to learn a diverse set of policies
to perform the task with different constraints imposed by the preferences. Then
we propose an algorithm called LfBD and show that we can build a parameterised
solution space that captures different behaviour patterns from the demonstrations.
In this solution space, a set of policies can be learned to produce behaviours that
not only capture the modes but also go beyond the provided demonstrations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Learning from demonstrations (LfD) provides an alternative way to Reinforcement
Learning (RL) for an agent to learn a policy by observing how humans perform similar tasks. How-
ever, in many real-world scenarios (e.g., driving a car), humans often perform the same task in
different ways. Their behaviours are not only influenced by the primary objective of the task (e.g.,
reaching the destination safely) but also by their individual preferences or expertise (e.g., different
driving styles) (Firnkranz & Hiillermeier| |2010} [Babes et al.| 2011). In other words, all the under-
lying policies maximize the same task reward, but under different constraints imposed by individual
preferences. This leads to a multi-modal distribution of demonstrations, where each mode represents
a unique behaviour.

With multi-modal demonstrations, typical LfD methods, such as Behaviour Cloning and Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning, either learn a policy that converges to one of the modes resulting in
a mode-seeking behaviour or exhibit a mean-seeking behaviour by trying to average across different
modes (2020). While the former will still
recover a subset of solutions, the latter may cause unknown behaviour (see Fig[I). Furthermore,
none of these approaches is able to learn policies that correspond to the behaviours of a wide range
of individuals. The problem becomes even more challenging when there are only “state observa-
tions” in the demonstrations without the actions. In such situations, supervised or unsupervised
learning approaches cannot be applied directly to find a policy, and the agent must interact with the

environment or with a simulator (Torabi et al.}/2019).

Being able to learn a diverse set of policies from demonstrations is often desirable to serve the
requirements of a wide range of individual users. For instance, every self-driving car can have a
driving policy (selected from the diverse set of pre-trained policies) that matches the preferences of
a user. Many recent works show the advantages of having a diverse set of policies, for instance,

2015) and safe sim-to-real policy transfer in robotics (Kaushik et al.}|2022).

Figure 1: Given the demonstrations from several individuals in A, the mean-seeking policy produces unseen
behaviour that is unsafe as shown in B, the mode-seeking policy only recovers one mode as shown in C. We

In this work, we consider a specific setup of LfD, known as Imitation Learning from Observations
alone (ILfO) where the learning agent only has access to the state observations
without their corresponding actions. We propose a new framework that combines Reinforcement
Learning with ILfO to solve the issues of learning from the multi-modal states-only demonstrations,
especially with a small set of unlabelled demonstrations. Unlike most of the LfD methods, our goal
is not just to learn how to perform a task or how to mimic humans, but rather how to perform a task in
all possible ways as shown in Fig Thus, we focus on applications where a high-level task reward
function can be defined easily, but the preference components that cause diverse behaviours cannot
be explicitly defined. These include tasks such as autonomous driving or robotic manipulations,
where the agent needs to mimic the human’s behaviour pattern (i.e., preference) while reaching the
intended goal (i.e., task reward).

In practice, defining a high-level task reward can be straightforward, i.e., for autonomous driving,
this can be a function of the distance to a target location and the penalty for collisions. However,
defining the preference component is far from easy, as it may be impossible to find a mathematical
expression for each individual’s preferences. Thus, we formulate the multimodal policy genera-
tion guided through demonstration as a constrained optimisation problem; where the generation of
multimodal behaviours results from optimising policies for a given task reward function that satisfy
different preference constraints.

As contributions, we first propose a new imitation-guided RL framework and an algorithm called
Learning from Behaviourally diverse Demosntration (LfBD) to solve the problem of policy genera-
tion from multimodal (state-only) demonstrations. We then propose a novel projection function that
captures preferences as state-region visitations. This projection function allows us to build a pa-
rameterised solution space to allocate policies such that they satisfy different preference constraints.
We show that our approach is capable of generating multimodal solutions beyond the provided
demonstrations, i.e. the resulting solutions also include interpolations between the provided demon-
strations. Furthermore, our method allows us to perform different types of post-hoc policy searches
in the solution space: 1) Given a (sate-only) demonstration, find the closest policy capable of gen-
erating this demonstration. 2) Search policies in the solution space that have a high/low likelihood
according to the provided demonstrations (i.e., similar to the provided demonstrations). 3) Find
solutions that satisfy different constraints.

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 IMITATION LEARNING AS DIVERGENCE MINIMISATION

In this section, we discuss why current Imitation Learning (IL) methods are incapable of dealing
with multi-modal demonstration distributions; especially, when only a small set of demonstrations

is available. [Zhang et al.| (2020); (2020); |Ghasemipour et al.| (2020) have shown that
current the Imitation learning (IL) methods can be derived as a family of f-divergence minimisation

methods, where the divergence of the state-action distributions of the expert p,,, (8, a) and learning

seeking) and the forward-KL (B, mean-seeking)

agent p,.,(s, a) is minimised using either Kullback-Lebler (KL) divergences or Jensen-Shanon (JS)
divergence. As KL divergence is not symmetric, both forward KL and reverse KL are used. And

depending on the choice of the divergence, the optimisation yields different results (Nowozin et al||
{2016} |Ke et al.}[2020} |Ghasemipour et al.|/2020) (see Fig[2). Additional details in Appx.

Behaviour cloning , a supervised off-line learning approach, is one of the ex-
amples that use forward KL to optimise its policy. In practice, it either follows a mean-seeking
behaviour under a stochastic policy and assumes data sampled during training are balanced or ex-
hibits a mode-seeking pattern. As it is a supervised learning method that lacks interaction with the
environment, it often requires a large amount of demonstration data in order to accurately estimate

the true state-action distribution (Neu & Szepesvari||2009).

One example of using reverse KL is Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (F
which recovers both the reward function and the policy by formulating IL as a min-max opti-
misation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2014). Here, the
generator serves as the policy network and a discriminator as the reward function. The opti-
mised objective is the reverse KL divergence, which can be expressed in terms of entropy H as:
Ey. (s,a) log Texp(s, @)] — H(Pro(s, @)). In practice, it faces additional challenges, such as the am-
biguity of the reward function (Ng et al} 2000} Arora & Doshil 2021) (i.e., many reward functions
could generate the same behaviours). Thus, its policy learning counterpart, Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning (GAIL) (Ho & Ermon|/2016) is more frequently used. This latter optimises the
JS divergence (Goodfellow et al.{[2014| 2020} |Ke et al.| /2020) with the causal

entropy as policy regularisation term.

Optimising the JS-divergence result in the same mode-seeking behaviour as the reverse KL (
2015). It further faces one of the most notorious problems of the GAN-based approach,
commonly known as mode collapse (Srivastava et al.| 2017} Bau et al.| 2019), where the genera-
tor collapses to produce only a small set of data samples (partial collapse) or even a single sample
(complete collapse), which disregards the multi-modal nature of the distribution. Furthermore, the
adversarial optimisation scheme in GAN-based methods further imposes other challenges, such as
instability in the optimisation. It is often difficult to guarantee that both the generator and the dis-
criminator converge optimally at the same time (Radford et al.|/2015). It is common to observe that
the loss of the discriminator converges very quickly to zero (Arjovsky & Bottou|
2018) that impedes the gradient updates of the generator. It often needs a considerably large number
of data and fine-tuning or additional regularization in order to stabilise the training process. The
optimisation of IL methods is convex if the actions are deterministic and the demonstrations cover
the complete state space (Neu & Szepesvari| 2009). In practice, it is always difficult to make sure
that the demonstrations span the entire state space; instead, they just cover one of the global optima
which ensures the convergence of the solution.

2.2. IMITATION LEARNING FROM OBSERVATION ONLY

Towards ILf0, {Torabi et al.|(2018) proposes a new approach called BCO, where an inverse dynamics
model is learnt through interaction with the environment and a policy is learnt from state observa-
tions by using the action inferred by the inverse dynamics. However, as with most LfD methods,
BCO does not handle multimodal demonstrations. Similarly, another approach called ILPO
) learns a forward dynamics model and a latent policy to circumvent the need
for the actions; however, it is limited to discrete action space. Latent policy learning from demon-
strations has also been proposed by fRen et al] (2020); (2021); [Wang et al] 20222).

based Imitation Learning 19) uses state alignment to recover state sequences close to
the demonstrations using local state alignment and global state alignment. While it shares some sim-
ilarities with our method (i.e., state distribution matching), it needs state-action pairs to pre-training
their model. A similar work is proposed in|Lee et al.] ). InfoGAIL ) combines
InfoGAN with GAIL to capture the variations of diverse demonstrations using
interpretable latent factors. However, it is not a state-only approach and suffers, in addition, from
the mode-collapse problem of GAN. 0) shares similarities with us by using
the sampling-based method to imitate unknown policies but with state-action demonstrations. The
closest work is perhaps by|(Ghasemipour et al.|(2020), where they recover a multi-modal policy from
state distributions that preserves 2 solution modes using a modified reverse KL. However, this mul-
timodality is due to the use of the stochastic policy(i.e., outputs mean and variance of a Gaussian
distribution). Unlike our approach, it does not allow the post-hoc policy search we propose, there-

fore, it cannot obtain a specific policy deterministically. |Shafiullah et al.|(2022) uses a transformer to
de

learn multimodal demonstrations; however, it does not deal with state-only data. Similar examples

include the diffusion model {Wang et al.||2022b) for path planning that focuses on in-distribution

data generation with access to the action set.

3 PROBLEM SETUP

Consider a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) (S,.A,p, po, R, 7,7’), where S C R&
and A C R“ are the continuous state and action spaces, p(s'|s, a) is the state-transition probability,
s and s’ are the current and the next state, a is the applied action, po the initial state distribution,
7 € [0,1] the discount factor, R : S x A — R the reward function, and T the time horizon.
We assume that this MPD has differentiable dynamics with a continuous states transition function
$141 = fe(Se, ae), such that d(sz, s¢41) < 6, with d as a distance metric, and 5 a small constant.

Let D = {70,71,---,Tn—1} be a set of state-trajectories (demonstrations) such that 7; =

(sh, 8{,---,8p_,), 81 © R&,7; € R?*4s. The demonstration set D results from a set of n hu-

man policies {7},(a|s)|i = 0 : n — 1}, where the subscript h indicates that it is a human policy,
which is inaccessible for us.

We hypothesise that while all human policies maximise the same task reward Riask(s, a), each
policy is constrained by a preference component. We define the preference component as the state
distribution, such that different individuals prefer to visit different states while solving the task.
Therefore, human policies are the results of solving the following constrained optimisation problem:

T-1

Tp, = arg max E| > 7! Rtask(St; ai)|r| ; (1)
t=0
subject to Dx r[pr(s)||gi(s)] < € (2)

where g;(s) = p(s|7i,) is the state distribution preferred by the individual i, and p,(s) the state
distribution of the learning agent. As different individuals optimise the task reward function with
different preferred states, the demonstration distribution can have multiple solution modes.

Our goal is to learn a large set of policies capable of solving the same task in different ways by
satisfying different preference components of the demonstrators, rather than learning a single way of
solving the task (i.e., mode-seeking policy or mean-seeking policy).Thus, we propose a setup where
the learning agent has access to a simulator to receive the task reward from the environment and to
observe the true dynamics of the system. At the same time, it receives the demonstrations D, where
it needs to optimise its policies for the different unobserved (as it is not explicitly defined) preference
components from these demonstrations. In other words, we propose to solve the objective above by
combining the optimisation scheme of RL with IL that uses a divergence minimisation scheme.

4 SKILL GENERATION FROM BEHAVIOURALLY DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS

Our method consists of two steps: (1) latent space modelling from the demonstration, and (2) diverse
policy generation on the latent space. In addition, our method allows us to perform post-hoc solution
searching on this space in order to obtain solutions (policies) that satisfy different constraints.

To find out a large set of policies, one for each g;(-) as per the KL constraint in Eq.|2| we first need
to construct a latent space Z, such that any g;(-) can be mapped onto that space. Now, if we use
a projection function that maps two similar g;(-)s closer to each other in the latent space Z, the
KL constraint in Eq. [2|can be approximated using a Euclidean constraint in this space Z. More
concretely, for some constant 6 € R*, z; € Z, and projection function Enc(-) the problem can be
reformulated on the latent space Z as

my 1= arg max E[(Rrask|™)], (3)
subject to || Enc(7,) — 2i||2 < 6

Practically, we want to find one policy for each z; € Z, optimising the objective in Eq.|3} where
z, are uniformly and densely distributed in the space Z. In other words, we want to optimize
policies for each niche so that the optimized policies maximise the task reward while producing state
trajectories specified by its own niche only. This is a quality-diversity optimization problem (
finding high-quality solutions according to a cost/fitness function in a space that
specifies the behaviour of the solutions. We solve this optimisation problem using a quality-diversity

algorithm called MAP-Elites (Mouret & Clune} 2015} Vassiliades et al.|[2017), where we determine

the behaviour of the solutions as the latent preferences extracted from our projection function.

4.1 LATENT SPACE MODELLING FROM DENSITY ESTIMATION

We first model the latent factors that explain the diversity in the behaviours from the demonstrations.
As mentioned in Sec. [3] we hypothesise that the diversity is caused by individual preference over
the state visitations; i.e., different individuals prefer visiting different regions in the state space. A
similar hypothesis has also been made in previous works such as max-margin planning

, where the reward function is recovered by matching the state-visitation frequency for every
single state and the state-action feature vector. While they use single state visitation counts, we
propose to estimate the state region visitation frequencies as latent preferences.

Figure 3: Generation of the latent space from the demonstration. The state observations (A) are modelled by a
GMM (B). The latent space (C) is built based on different combinations of mixture components.

Given the state distributions from the demonstrations p(s) as defined in Sec we use a
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of k mixture components to model the density as p(s) =

yk diN(s|i, 01), where ¢; is the mixture weight for each mixture component. This state density
p(s) models the state observations of all the demonstrations. Under the assumption of a continuous
state transition,i.e., states close in time will be in the same state region (see Sec 3). each mixture
component will cover a state region in the state space. The state distribution of each individual,
gi, belongs to a subset of the entire state distribution. As a mixture component can be seen as
a state region, different trajectories would have different state region visitations or assigned mix-
ture components. Given a fitted GMM model, we can estimate the state distribution of each g;(s)
given its observations by a subset of mixture components according to their corresponding posterior
probability or responsibilities p(k|s). That is, given the sequence of states, we can estimate the
responsibilities p(k|s) for these states using the fitted GMM, and use the corresponding mixtures to
approximate its state distribution. Given the assigned mixture components {k,;}, and their assign-

ment frequencies five, number of assignment for each component w.r.t the total number of states

of these mixture components as g;(s) © )> EN (s\n, ;Ok;), Where the assigned mixture compo-
nents correspond to state region visitations, and the new mixture weight is readjusted based on their

assignment frequencies fi.

Now, we can define our projection function, or encoder function Enc : R?X4s _, R&d, <
(T x ds), based on the assignment of the mixture components. Given a set of states from a policy,
the GMM is used as an unsupervised clustering method to classify these states into different mixture
components. There are different ways to represent this information. For instance, we can have an
encoding of size Kv and give the frequency values of each component [f1, f2,... fx]. However,
to limit the size of the encoding, we choose to take the indices of the m most frequently assigned
components without explicit referring to the actual frequencies (detailed algorithm in Appx. Algo|
The precision of the mapping depends on our choice of m as we will have information loss with a
small value of m (further discussion in Appx.

Implicitly, we are defining the feature vector of a trajectory as the mixture components that are
responsible for its states. The visitation frequency is explicitly taken into account by taking the top
d, most assigned mixture components in descending order. In addition, the use of GMM allows us
to evaluate the likelihood of a given trajectory according to the density distribution modelled from
demonstrations. For instance, given the example of Fig/4} we can evaluate whether these trajectories
belong to in-distribution data or out-of-distribution based on their likelihood (of the state sequence).

Solution matching We can measure the similarity of 2 trajectories by measuring their associated
mixture components. As we have the analytical form of each component (e.g., Gaussian with its
mean and variance), we can directly measure the distance between their distributions by using mea-
surement of our choice, such as Bhattacharyya distance or KL divergence.

4.2. MAP-ELITES (EA) AS DYNAMICS-AWARE CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE MODEL

Given Z as the latent space defined by the projection function, we aim to generate a solution archive
P. parameterised by the latent encoding z, where each entry in this archive has a unique encoding
z. The goal is to generate policies and map them into this space according to encoding values for
their respective g(-). While the latent space contains all the possible state distributions defined by
the mixture components of the GMM, the solution space is constrained by the system’s dynamics,
as the possible solutions are subject to the system constraints that cannot generate certain state
distributions. Thus, P, C Z. As the solution archive is the result of filling the latent space with
policies, we may use latent space interchangeably to refer to the empty solution space.

EA can be seen as an implicit state density model over states with high fitness/reward (
. In our case, as EA optimises each instance of encoding, which is associated (deterministi-
cally) with a given mixture model, the generation of this space is equivalent to an implicit density
modelling conditioned on the latent encodings. Thus, we refer to our method as a conditional gen-
erative model that generates policies conditioned on different encodings. The workflow is shown in
Fig[5] and the detailed algorithm in Appx. 2]

As mentioned in Sec. [4] we use MAP-Elites as the algorithm of our choice. It starts with sampling
N random policy parameters from a uniform distribution: 0;=0:n—1 ~ Ua}: Then it evaluates the
policies in simulation using the reward function Riasx(-, +), and at the same time generates the state
trajectories T;<0:n—1, and their corresponding encodings z;<0;n—1. Then the policies are inserted
into the closest cells in the solution archive P. If two policies compete for the same cell, the one
with a higher reward occupies the cell. Once this initialization is done, MAP-Elites randomly selects
a policy from the archive, adds a small random noise (mutation) to the parameters, and evaluates the
policy on the simulator for the reward, state trajectory, and the corresponding encoding. This new
policy is inserted into the archive if either the cell is empty or the new policy has a higher reward; the

space according to their encoding. Then, in a loop, policies are selected from the archive, small variations are
added, and new encodings are obtained to insert them into the archive based on their reward.

policy is discarded otherwise. The selection, variation, and insertion continue until the maximum
assigned policy evaluation count is reached.

As the highest rewarding policies occupy the nearest cells in the archive, those policies produce
maximally rewarding behaviour staying close to the state distribution specified in the cell. In other
words, the policies in the archive essentially optimise the objective in Eq.]for different z;.

Post-hoc policy search Having a set of solutions parameterised by latent encodings allows us to
find solutions in a post-hoc manner that satisfy different constraints. For instance, a solution archive
G built for a 2D navigation environment with one obstacle contains solutions for an equivalent
environment 7 with two obstacles, as the latter space is more restricted, where 7 C G (see example
in Sec. In addition, given a new demonstration, we can find the closest policy in our archive
by finding a policy with the closest distribution distance (see Sec. and Alg.[3) according to the
encodings.

5 EXPERIMENTS

We present 3 experiments with continuous state and action spaces to show that our method is capable
of generating a solution archive that optimises implicitly the density distribution from demonstra-
tions. We propose 2 (motion) planning examples where the task is to generate a non-colliding path
from two points in an end-to-end manner. The first is a 2D toy path planning environment and
the second is a robotic arm motion planning environment using the Franka Emika robot with Py-
bullet (2016-2021) as the physic simulator. In both cases, we use only the XY
position coordinates as the state observation. For Franka, we fixed the Z axis, as the demon: ions
do not contain Z coordinates. Finally, we show a driving experiment modified on (

experiments are run 3 times. The average performance and further ablation study (time, number of
valid solutions vs encoding choices) can be found in Appx.

2D path planning We use 28 non-colliding trajectories with fixed lengths that are generated arti-
ficially using Bézier curves as shown in Fig|6/A. We use B-spline as the policy function, which takes
5 control points in total to generate a flexible curve as parameters, where the first and last control
points are start and end coordinates, and the resulting points are the parameters of the policy, 9 € R°.
We use a GMM of 20 components for the multimodal distribution and 10 for the single-mode dis-
tributions. Under the exact same setup, we show that the control points are optimised towards state
distributions modelled by their respective GMM. As shown in Fig 6 the resulting control points
from the single-mode setup are scattered mainly in the region within single-mode state distribution.
While for the multi-modal setup, the control points are scattered in both regions of the state space.
This comparison is even more noticeable after filtering out the solutions with a higher likelihood
(according to their respective GMM models). We show that even though the demonstrations only

cover one solution mode, our method is still capable of discovering multimodal solutions, where the
unseen solutions from the demonstrations will have lower likelihood values.

As VAE is commonly used as a feature encoding method as well as a (conditional) generative model,
we show its capability of feature encoding and generation ability in this setup. We use the same en-
coding size, and trained the model for 30000 iterations (details in Sec for
a small dataset, the generator suffers from partial collapse that only generates samples from certain
modes and fails to produce diverse samples. The same observation occurs for the encoder, it fails
to produce unique encoding values as shown in Fig.|7{B, D). While training the same model using
the data generated from our solution, both its capability of reconstruction and encoding improves
considerably. However, unlike our projection function, it does not provide an interpretable encoding
value. And it cannot take the advantage of the simulator that is available to interact with. Another
alternative method is GAN, but it does not work when a small amount of data is provided, and it
suffers from the mode collapse even though a large amount of data is available (see Se

Franka arm manipulation We use the same setup here as in the previous case, except the mixture
component to model the state density increases to 25 as more data is available. We collected 140
demonstrations in real life using a motion tracker to track the movement of a pointer to draw the
trajectories without considering the real dynamics of the robot. The length of demos spans between
240 and 726 time-steps. This 3D environment contains 3D obstacle, where the resulting trajectories

using VAE trained on demonstrations generated by our method (see Fig|7(C) and the result from
our proposed projection function (more details in Appx. [A-3.2). The results show that our projec-
tion function enables better matches, as we can measure the distances between the underlying state
distributions based on the encoding values (see Sec.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that allows us to build a solution space where we gen-
erate a diverse range of behaviours from a small set of state-only observations. We show empirically
that our method optimises all the policies in the space towards different state density constraints
while optimising the task reward. With our proposed projection function that encodes state transi-
tions into meaningful statistical encoding, we can perform a post-hoc policy search in the projected
space searching for different policies. Our experimental results show that we are capable of generat-
ing multimodal solutions deterministically beyond the provided demonstrations. Further discussion
regarding its application use is included in Appex.[A.8]

A.2 KL DIVERGENCE MINIMISATION FOR MULTIMODAL DISTRIBUTION

As KL divergence is not symmetric, the reverse KL and forward KL exhibit very different be-
haviours. These are also known as Moment projection and Information projection respectively.

Given the state-action observations from the demonstrations from the expert’s policy 72), M-
projection minimises the following forward KL:

m= arg minDacy (Prenp (5; a) || Pro(s, a)) >

Dei = J Preon(ssa) 108 (Ge) d(s,a) =Ep,. (sa) [08 (a) ; ”

Pro (8, @) Pro (8)

While the I-projection minimises the following reverse KL:

13
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023

TT) = arg minDart (Drenp (8; @) \| Pro (8,4) ;

Pro(S,@) Pro (8,4)

For M-projection, the difference between p;,,,(8,@) and px,(s,a) is weighted by pz,,,,(s, a).
Which means that when p-.,,,(s,@) = 0, the discrepancy of pz,(s,a) > 0 from pz,,,,(s,@) will
be ignored. Mathematically, this means that p,,,,,(s,a) will typically over-estimate the support
of pz, (s,a), due to Prep (Ss a) > 0 whenever p,, > 0 to make sure KL divergence stays finite.
As result, the projecting exhibits a mean-seeking, also known as moment-matching, behaviour that
averages over several modes given a multimodal distribution. While it avoids the low probability
assignment of the region with data (e.g., the other mode of the distribution), it inevitably assigns

probability mass to non-data region (Theis et al.|/2015) as shown in Fig[2]

For I-projection, as difference between p,.,,,,(8,a) and pz,(s,a) is weighted by px,(s,@). Px), (8, @)
will typically under-estimate the support of p,, and concentrate on one of its modes that results
in a mode-seeking behaviour. This is due to px,,,(8,a) = 0 whenever p,,(s,a) = 0 to make
sure KL divergence stays finite. Using this projection is not straightforward as we might only have
access to samples from the distribution rather than the data density itself ( 3), where
M-projection can be done easily by maximising the average log-likelihood with respect to the given
training dataset as an equivalent way of minimising the KL.

A.2.1 EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS

Given the multi-mode and single-mode demonstrations of the 2D path planning environment, we
proposed in Sec. We show the results of Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) model, build on
the same GMMs we used for our method (see While it performs well in the single-mode
demonstrations, the result from the multimodal distribution exhibits a mean-seeking behaviour as

shown in Fig/T]]

with 95% confidence interval from a GMR trained on multimodal demonstrations. Middle/Left: GMR predic-
tions on single-mode demonstrations.

Extending the discussion in Sec|2.1]about GAN in dealing with multimodal distribution. We show
experimentally the performance of GAN in generating trajectories for the 2D path planning environ-
ment. As GAN cannot deal with a small dataset, we trained it using the trajectories generated by our
archive, which contains 3881 trajectories. The results are shown in Fig/12] The discriminator takes
the entire trajectory as the input and has 3 hidden layers with 128, 32, and 8 neurons respectively.
The generator takes an input of a 7-dimensional vector and uses 3 hidden layers with 128, 64, and
32 neurons respectively to generate the trajectory of the same size. The model is trained for 23000
iterations. The results are consistent with mode-seeking behaviour where it converges to one of the
solution modes discussed in Sec[2.1]

A.3 EXPERIMENT SETUPS AND REPRODUCIBILITY
We train all the GMM models using sklearn library with a fixed random state to ensure reproducibil-

ity. The experiments were run 3 times per setup (e.g., multimode and single-mode demonstrations),
with 2 different types of encodings. We show the average result for single-mode demonstrations and

multimodal demonstrations. As most of the experiments allow us to run parallel threads. We record
both the average true elapsed time and the average CPU time, with their standard deviation. The re-
sults are shown in Table[I] For 2D path planning, we use Intel Core i7-6850K CPU @3.60GHz with
6 cores and trained our model using 12 parallel threads. For Franka, we use a single thread process
with 1 CPU core of Xeon Gold 6148 @2.40GHz, and 16GB of RAM without multi-threading due
to the high memory demand from the physical simulator. For the highway environment, we use 8
cores of Intel Xeon Gold 6248 @2.50GHz with 12 parallel threads and 8GB of RAM.

In the highway environment, we use neural networks with 2 hidden layers of 8 and 16 neurons
respectively as policy. The total number of parameters is 201 elements. The parameters of the
networks are purely optimised using random sampling and perturbation from EA without any back-
propagation. As we use the exact setup from 2D path planning in the Franka environment to show
the applicability of our methods in ”real” applications besides the 2D path planning experiment,
we only test the result in the multi-modal setup. To ensure maximum reproducibility, the solution
archive is initialised with 104 solutions with uniformly sampled parameters from a given parameter
space to minimise the advantage of a good initialisation. The parameter space for 2D path planning
is defined within the range of [—5, 5], while for Franka it is defined within [0, 1] and for highway
within [—1, 1].

As we tested 2 different types of encoding, we report the performance results in the ablation study
(see Appx.[A.5), where we discuss the impact of the size of the encodings vs the size of the solution
archive, among the others.

A.3.1 SETUP FOR VAE

We use a VAE with 5 hidden layers with 256,128,64, 64,32 neurons correspondingly. Unlike our
projection function, the VAE cannot handle data of different sizes, instead, it receives the full tra-
jectory with a fixed length. Thus, it cannot deal with the demonstrations intended for Franka Arm
environment, as they have various sizes.

A.3.2 POLICY SEARCH USING ENCODING MATCHING

Given a demonstration, we search for the closest policy by finding the one with the minimal distance
in the encoding space. The algorithm can be found in Alg.3]

To compare the result of VAE with our method, we use the samples generated by VAE (see Fig.[7p),

A.4 MODEL SECTION OF GMM

The model selection, i.e., the number of GMM components used to model the state density distri-
bution from the demonstration, is determined by Bayesian Information-theoretic criteria (BIC). We
choose the model with lower BIC as the common practice. The GMM used for the 2D path planning
environment is shown in Fig|13]using confidence ellipsoid. The GMM used for the Franka envi-
ronment is shown in Fig[14] We omit the visualisation for the highway environment, as we use 4D
Gaussian which cannot be visualised with confidence ellipsoid.

multimodal demonstrations. Middle: GMM confidence ellipsoid for the single-mode demonstrations (upper
region). Right: GMM confidence ellipsoid for the single demonstrations (lower region).

A.5 ABLATION STUDIES AND NUMERICAL QUANTIFICATION OF SOLUTION ARCHIVE

In this section, we analyse the performance of our method by analysing the resulting solution archive
generated by our method. We include as the performance indicator the total number of policies
generated and the total valid solutions that reach the given task reward, i.e., reaching the goal while
preventing the collisions. We report the results under different setups.

A.5.1 COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT ENCODINGS

We compare 2 different type of encoding:
mixture component as discussed in Sec

1) Encoding with the top 6 most frequently assigned
shown in Table 2) Same encoding but with an

16
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023

additional likelihood value added. This latter is proposed to avoid the case of having two different
trajectories with the same encoding but with different likelihood values (i.e., out-of-distribution
trajectories that happened to be mapped to the same encoding), shown in Table [3] In the case of
the point environment, the inclusion of likelihood does not increase the size of the final solution
archive. We hypothesise that this is caused by the segmentation of the solution space, as the average
likelihood is low in general for all the trajectories (see the likelihood values for the trajectories in
Fig [6p. it worsens the uniform segmentation of the space. In reality, while different trajectories
can have the assigned mixture components, their respective frequencies may rarely coincide. For
instance, in Fig/4] two trajectories can have the same assigned component with low and high average
likelihood respectively, but their resulting encodings are different due to the different frequency
values. Thus, these trajectories will not compete for the same niche in the solution space. While
in the case of highway environment, the inclusion of the likelihood does increase the size of the
descriptor as the average likelihood values are higher, which span within [0, 1] (see the colour map
for the trajectories in Fig), which allows a uniform segmentation of the archive space.

Approaches as (2021) has used Hidden semi-Markov Models to extract the temporal
sequence of the demonstration for imitation learning, which takes the transition probability between

different mixture models into account. Our encoding does not consider the transition probability
between different mixture components; the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) could be done as
a potential future work.

A.5.2 COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR GMM

Encoding space dimensionality. Given a GMM with dgmm components and an encoding size of
d,. The number of possible encodings is defined by different permutation of dgmm , its size has a

theoretical upper bound of me
dynamics, e.g., it may be impossible to have a state distribution with only 2 different state regions

that are far away from each other as the state transition is continuous.

In practice, its real upper bound depends on the system’s

As discussed, the size of the latent (encoding) space depends on the number of mixture components
that represent different state region visitation and the size of the descriptor to choose. Here we
show the result of using 2 different GMMs with 10 and 5 mixture components respectively that have
higher BIC scores compared to the GMM with 20 components (see model selection in[A.4).

17
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023

For the GMM with 10 components, we keep the size of descriptor unchanged, i.e., 7, while for the
GMM of 5 components, we reduced it to 4 as the total number of components is reduced. For the
former case, the number of total solutions is reduced to 1163 trajectories with 854 valid trajectories
on average for the former case. While for the latter case, the sizes reduces to 120 total trajectories and
105 valid trajectories respectively. This is due to the fact that a lower number of mixture components
will reduce the size of the latent space. The result is shown in Fig/I5]

Figure 15: Comparison of solution archives optimised with different size of GMM mixture components in the
projection function. Left: Mixture component with 10 components, and the resulting solution archive with
valid trajectories shown with colour map that corresponds to their respective likelihood values. Right: Mixture
component with 5 components and the associated solution archive with valid trajectories with their respective
likelihoods.

A.6 POST-HOC SOLUTION SEARCH FOR CHANGING SIMULATOR

In this section, we show that the solution archive trained on the toy 2D path planning environment
with 2D obstacles contains valid solutions for the Franka arm environment with 3D obstacles. Where
the former does not have any physic engine or accurate collision detection mechanism; while the
latter is a high-fidelity simulator with a real physic simulator and sophisticated collision detection.
And the state space for the 2D environment is defined to be the same as the Franka environment.

We configure the toy environment to have the approximate location of the obstacle. In the case of
the Franka environment, the obstacle is a 3-dimensional cube instead of a 2D obstacle (see Fig[BA).
Thus, the collision detection of the toy environment is far from perfect compared to the Franka
environment. We use the same parameters set up as detailed in Sec
is fitted to the demonstrations recorded for the Franka arm (see Fig}14). Training on a simplified
simulator has its advantage such as faster convergence speed; it reduces the training time as the
simulation time is faster in the toy environment. As we can see from Table/1| the training time for
Franka (649m) is considerably longer than the 2D environment (3m49s) due to the slow physic
simulation. By allowing access to the simulator, we can filter out solutions by simulating the policies
from the trained solution archive in the environment to validate them under different constraints. In
this case, the constraints are different due to the change in the environment. The final solution
archive trained in the 2D toy environment contains 9076 solutions, with 5978 valid collision-free
solutions for the Franka environment that reach the goal location.

In addition to bimodal demonstrations for the 2D path planning in Sec. we include a new sce-
nario where more solution modes are present in the demonstrations to show that our method can
deal with more solution modes. Here we use a total of 12 demonstrations generated using sine and
cosine functions and used the same parameters’ setup as the previous experiment. The GMM takes
20 mixture components, and we use a 6-dimensional encoding value. The resulting solution archive
contains 6309 trajectories as shown in Fig[I7] While the solution archive built from bimodal demon-
strations contains also multiple solution modes such as interpolation results, these demonstrations
present with lower likelihood values as shown by its colour map (see Fig [6] {LO}). However, in
this four-mode solution case, we can observe clearly that the intersecting trajectories have higher
likelihood values due to the presence of data points in the demonstrations.

A.8 POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS

We dedicate this section to discussing the applicability of our method. One of the potential applica-
tions is data augmentation. Given a small set of state-only demonstrations, our method is capable to
generate diverse state-action demonstrations. These can be used, for instance, to provide more data
input to other approaches. One example is shown in the performance analysis of VAE in Fig/7| VAE
suffers from mode collapse when it is trained using a small dataset. However, our method can gener-
ate a large set of demonstrations to train the VAE to produce more diverse samples. However, notice
here that in this case, VAE does not necessarily extrapolate beyond the provided demonstrations.

In practice, a more useful use case is the recollection of visual demonstrations in a high-fidelity
environment. For instance, as shown from our Franka Arm environment, we are capable to generate
a large set of demonstrations. While our approach currently does not support image-based input, it
can be used to generate training data for image-based methods by recording the resulting trajectories
in the simulator.

Another potential application is the search for policies that satisfy different constrains, such as con-
straints from different environments or policies that are capable of producing certain behaviours
using encoding matching, as shown in Appx. and Sec. [5]
